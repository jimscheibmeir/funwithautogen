You might have seen a short video of this code briefly explained on LI.

The code is a basic AI agent formed by two teams.
The first uses a browser to find an article, summarize, and generate helpful hashtags.
The second agent team takes that summary/etc and uses a tool to send as a tweet to the X platform.

It is wrapped using Flask

It is missing so much...evals/guardrails/security/auth and more.

A simple and fun example, no more.
